## Features

- [x] `prewersion` & `postwersion` scripts
- [x] `npm`, `pnpm`, `Yarn Classic (v1)` & `Yarn Berry (v2, v3)` package managers
- [x] `--dry-run` CLI option

## Roadmap

- [ ] `allowedBranches` configuration key
- [ ] Specified version support (i.e. `wersion 1.2.3`)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- npm, pnpm or Yarn v1/v3
- Setting the `workspaces` field in your `package.json` file (i.e. `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]``)

### First Setup

First, install Wersion:

```sh
yarn add -DE wersion
# or
pnpm i -DE wersion
# or
npm i -DE wersion
# or
npm i -g wersion # to install it globally
```

## Usage

Simply run:

```sh
yarn wersion <release>
# or
pnpm wersion <release>
# or
npx wersion <release>
# or
wersion <release> # if installed globally
```

`<release>` can be one of: "patch", "minor", "major", "prepatch", "preminor", "premajor" or "prewersion".

You can run it with `--dry-run` or `-d` to see what would happen without actually bumping your packages versions.

### Pre & Post Scripts

In your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prewersion": "echo \"The version will be bumped from v${PREVIOUS_VERSION} to v${NEXT_VERSION}.\"",
    "postwersion": "echo \"The version has been bumped from v${PREVIOUS_VERSION} to v${NEXT_VERSION}.\""
  }
}
```
